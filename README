Eventlet + Flask
================

The purpose of this repository is to provide for a general purpose eventlet
server that can power just about any Flask Application. It is my hope that is
used to rapidly spin up a WSGI server which has support for many common
configurations.


Usage
-----

To use the server look at extending / subclassing the Application module found
at ``evenlet_wsgi.api.application.MainApplication``. When ready you can call
the run method at ``eventlet_wsgi.run.executable``.


Pseudo Code
-----------

You can see a full example of how to use this in the ``example`` directory


Operational Tasks
-----------------

If you look in the ``etc`` directory you will several example configuration
files as well as an example init script.
